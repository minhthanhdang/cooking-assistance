# Cooking Assistance

Cooking Assistance is an Android app that keep track of cooking recipes, with necessary timer functions.

If you are learning how to cook the dish the first time, you can store image, cooking ingredients and cooking steps in the app.
Next time, you can just open the app and follow the steps!
Instead of using an external timer, you can use the built-in as well!
